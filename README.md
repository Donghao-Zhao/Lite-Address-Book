Homework for the course Embedded System Development.

Time usage: 18 hours

Very crude codes completely done on my own.

Sorry that I didn't use standard data structure, and due to the limitation of time, I didn't write any annotations.

Introduction to usage:

    System environment: Ubuntu 17.04 (in theory, any Linux can do it)
    Editor: VIM (default configuration after apt get)
    Compiler: GCC (6.3.0 20170406 (Ubuntu 6.3.0-12ubuntu 2))
    Debugger: GDB
    Project Manager: make

    In Linux system:

    1. Copy the following source code to a new file and save it as a file with the suffix ". C"
    2. Compile the file with GCC to generate executable file
    3. Execute the executable file to enter the address book system
    4. The directory of the file will be generated data.dat File as database This is normal
    5. For other operations, please look at the program, and don't write the documentation
